I wanted to put my skills from previous internships to use, so I decided that I'd try them out on this dataset.

I've used Postgres + Django + D3 (The stack I used in my previous internship).

While it may be overkill, I just wanted to practice using the tech. The added UI, and built in search and filtering though is very handy.
I hope that data scientists who are not as programming savvy will be able to use these visualizations and UI to help enhance their data analytics. 

This is my first personal project on Github! So apologies if I commit anything that is very messy or not meta.
